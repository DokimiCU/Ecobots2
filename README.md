# Ecobots2
by Dokimi

Current version: 0.1 Development. Functional, but gameplay aspects missing.

An alien world inhabited by a selfreplicating alien superorganism.

# Instructions:
Find a location with dormant bots. Wait around, or hit them to wake them up. Watch them grow. Intervene using the tools provided.

Tools
- Metabolic Inducer: forces the bot to undergo a metabolic cycle (speeds up growth).
- Feed Injector: feeds the bot.
- Light Meter: measures light (bots are photosynthetic)
- Mutagenic Probe: mutates the bot.
- Spore Inducer: causes the bot to reproduce by releasing spores.
- Life Signs Analyzer: reads core information about the bot's status.


# How does this work?:

Bots act like living things, growing reproducing, dying, evolving.

Bots capture energy, produce waste, and create offspring which inherit their genome. 
- Metabolic rate: cycles through life processes faster or slower.
- Energy: bots must gain energy to survive and grow.
- Waste: bots use of energy produces toxic byproducts that must be excreted (either as gas, or liquid, or solid)
- Age: ticks up with each metabolic cycle. Added on as a cost to basal rate.
- Basal rate: how much energy is used and waste is produced per metabolic cycle.
- Max Storage: how much energy and waste it can store, and how much it requires to create an offspring.
- Parental investment: parents energy given to offspring to get the child started out.
- Spores: can spread by spores as well as by clonal spreading. Spores have rudimentary swarm intelligence.
- Clonal: clonal bots exchange resources and waste with each other, acting as a co-operative superorganism.
- Support structures: bots with support structures can create useful structures and specialized bots.
  - phloem: "pipes" for energy and waste exchange.
  - nephron: waste excretion
  - dermis: non-divding photosynthetic cell.
- Evolution: asexual inheritance + mutation. RK factor is the only gene. Low = fast and simple. High = slow and complicated.
- Other bots: decomposer eats the dead, phage virus infects the living.
